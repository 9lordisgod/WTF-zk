# WTF zk Tutorial Milestone 02: Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm

In this lesson, we will cover the second milestone of the WTF zk zero-knowledge proof tutorial. By now, you should have a solid understanding of number theory and group theory. In this milestone, we will learn about the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm, which is a method for securely sharing keys over an insecure communication channel. This algorithm is a fundamental building block in cryptography and forms the basis for secure communication.

## 1. Introduction

The Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm was first proposed by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1976. It is a public-key cryptographic algorithm that enables two remote users to establish a shared key without actually exchanging the key itself.

- **Public-Key Cryptography:** The Diffie-Hellman algorithm is the earliest public-key cryptographic algorithm. Its introduction revolutionized the way keys are shared and laid the groundwork for modern secure communication.

- **Security:** By leveraging the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem, the two parties can securely negotiate a shared key without revealing their private keys.

- **Wide Applications:** The Diffie-Hellman algorithm is widely used in the field of secure communication, including protocols like TLS/SSL and SSH.

## 2. Algorithm Overview

The core idea of the Diffie-Hellman algorithm lies in the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem. Given a large prime number p, a base number g, and the equation $A \equiv g^a \mod p$, it is computationally difficult to determine the value of a. The algorithm consists of the following steps:

### 2.1 Key Generation

1. **Parameter Selection:** Choose two large prime numbers p and a generator (multiplicative generator) g. Both p and g are public.
2. **Private Key Generation:** Each party selects a private key. Let's say Alice chooses the private key $a$, and Bob chooses the private key $b$. Both $a$ and $b$ are kept secret.
3. **Compute Public Key:** Alice computes $A = g^a \mod p$, and Bob computes $B = g^b \mod p$.
4. **Exchange Public Keys:** Alice sends $A$ to Bob, and Bob sends $B$ to Alice. At this point, both A and B are public.

In this step, the public keys $p, g, A, B$ are public, while the private keys $a, b$ remain private.

### 2.2 Key Agreement

1. **Compute Session Key:** After receiving Bob's public key $B$, Alice computes $K = B^a \mod p$. Similarly, after receiving Alice's public key $A$, Bob computes $K = A^b \mod p$.
2. **Generate Shared Key:** Alice and Bob now have the same key $K$, which can be used as a session key for encrypted communication. Since an eavesdropper does not have the information of $a$ and $b$, they cannot compute $K$. Therefore, the key $K$ remains private.

## 3. Example

To better understand the Diffie-Hellman algorithm, let's use a simple example to illustrate the process.

1. **Parameter Selection:** Choose the prime number $p = 13$ and its generator $g = 6$.
2. **Private Key Generation:** Alice chooses the private key $a = 5$, and Bob chooses the private key $b = 4$.
3. **Compute Public Key:** Alice computes $A = 6^5 = 2 \mod 13$, and Bob computes $B = 6^{4} = 9 \mod 13$.
4. **Exchange Public Keys:** Alice sends $A = 2$ to Bob, and Bob sends $B = 9$ to Alice.
5. **Compute Session Key:** Alice computes $K = 9^5 \mod 13 = 3$, and Bob computes $K = 2^{4} \mod 13 = 3$.
6. **Generate Shared Key:** Alice and Bob now have the same shared key $K = 3$, which can be used for further encrypted communication.

## 4. Algorithm Logic

The security of the Diffie-Hellman algorithm is based on the computational difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem. For an eavesdropper, the only information they can obtain is the prime number $p$, the generator $g$, Alice's public key $A = g^a \mod p$, and Bob's public key $B = g^b \mod p$. To obtain the shared key $K =g^{ab} \mod p$, the eavesdropper would need to compute $a = \log_g{A}$ or $b = \log_g{B}$, which is the discrete logarithm problem. However, there is no efficient algorithm to solve this problem, making it computationally infeasible. Therefore, the Diffie-Hellman algorithm is secure.

Additionally, since $p$ is a large prime number, the order (number of elements) of the multiplicative group $Z^*_p$ modulo $p$ is $p-1$, which is very large. As the generator $g$ is a generator of $Z^*_p$, its powers can cover all elements in $Z^*_p$, making it computationally difficult to solve the discrete logarithm problem through brute force.

## 5. Code Implementation

Here is a simple Python implementation that demonstrates the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm.

```python
import random

def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def modinv(a, b):
    m0, x0, x1 = b, 0, 1
    while a > 1:
        q = a // b
        a, b = b, a % b
        x0, x1 = x1 - q * x0, x0
    return x1 + m0 if x1 < 0 else x1

def generate_params():
    p = random_prime()
    g = random.randint(2, p - 2)
    return p, g

def generate_private_key():
    return random.randint(2, 2**16)

def generate_public_key(private_key, p, g):
    return pow(g, private_key, p)

def generate_shared_secret(private_key, public_key, p):
    return pow(public_key, private_key, p)

def random_prime():
    while True:
        num = random.randint(10**3, 10**4)
        if is_prime(num):
            return num

# Example
p, g = generate_params()
alice_private_key = generate_private_key()
bob_private_key = generate_private_key()

alice_public_key = generate_public_key(alice_private_key, p, g)
bob_public_key = generate_public_key(bob_private_key, p, g)

alice_shared_secret = generate_shared_secret(alice_private_key, bob_public_key, p)
bob_shared_secret = generate_shared_secret(bob_private_key, alice_public_key, p)

print("Prime number (p):", p)
print("Generator (g):", g)
print("Alice's private key:", alice_private_key)
print("Bob's private key:", bob_private_key)
print("Alice's public key:", alice_public_key)
print("Bob's public key:", bob_public_key)
print("Shared secret (Alice):", alice_shared_secret)
print("Shared secret (Bob):", bob_shared_secret)

## Output Example
# Prime number (p): 2707
# Generator (g): 1620
# Alice's private key: 8706
# Bob's private key: 60566
# Alice's public key: 1183
# Bob's public key: 2369
# Shared secret (Alice): 1776
# Shared secret (Bob): 1776
```
