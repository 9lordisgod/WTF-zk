# WTF zk Lesson 17: Cyclic Groups

In this lesson, we will explore cyclic groups, which are groups generated by a single element. Cyclic groups have simple yet significant properties and are widely used in cryptography and mathematics.

## 1. Cyclic Groups

The simplest non-trivial group, which contains only the identity element, is denoted as $(\{0\}, +)$. It consists of only one element and satisfies the four basic properties of a group. So what is the simplest non-trivial group? Let's consider a group $(G, \circ)$ that contains an element $a$ in addition to the identity element $e$. In order for $G$ to be a group, it must also contain the inverse of $a$ and the operation of combining $a$ with itself. In other words,

$$
G = \{..., a^{-3}, a^{-2}, a^{-1}, e, a, a^2, a^3, ...\}
$$

This is the group generated by $a$, also known as a cyclic group.

**Definition:** A cyclic group is a group generated by a single element. Let $(G, \circ)$ be a group. If there exists an element $g \in G$ such that all the elements obtained by repeatedly applying the group operation to $g$ form the set $G$, i.e., $G = \left \langle \, g \, \right \rangle =  \{g^n \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$, then $(G, \circ)$ is a cyclic group. The element $g$ is called the generator.

The group of integer addition $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$ is an example of a cyclic group. It can be generated by either $1$ or $-1$, and any integer can be obtained by adding the generator repeatedly. For example, $5 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1$.

For any integer $m$, the group of integer multiples of $m$ $(m\mathbb{Z}, +)$ is also a cyclic group because $m\mathbb{Z} = \{m^z | z \in \mathbb{Z}\} = \{mz | z \in \mathbb{Z}\} = \left \langle \, m \, \right \rangle$, and its generator is $m$.

The group of integer modulo $6$ addition $(\mathbb{Z}_6, +)$ is also a cyclic group. Its generator is $1$. The elements in this group, namely ${0, 1,2,3,4,5}$, can all be obtained by cyclically adding $1$. For example, $1^6 \equiv 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod 6$, and $1^7 \equiv 7 \equiv 1 \pmod 6$, which enters a cycle.

The group of integer modulo $5$ multiplication $(\mathbb{Z}^*_5, \times)$ is also a cyclic group. Its generator can be $2$ or $3$. For $2$: $2^1 = 2$, $2^2 = 4$, $2^3 = 3$, $2^4 = 1$, and $2^5 = 2$, which enters a cycle. For $3$: $3^1 = 3$, $3^2 = 4$, $3^3 = 2$, $3^4 = 1$, and $3^5 = 3$, which enters a cycle.

### 1.1 Properties of Cyclic Groups

Here are some basic properties of cyclic groups:

**1. Cyclic groups are all Abelian groups.**

<details><summary>ProofðŸ‘€</summary>

Let the cyclic group $(G, \circ) = \left \langle \, g \, \right \rangle$. For any $a, b \in G$, assuming $a = g^x$ and $b = g^y$, we have $a \circ b = g^x \circ g^y=g^{x+y}=g^{y+x} = g^y \circ g^x = b \circ a$. Therefore, the cyclic group $(G, \circ) = \left \langle \, g \, \right \rangle$ satisfies the commutative law and is an Abelian group. Proof complete.

</details>

**2. Subgroups of cyclic groups are also cyclic groups.**

<details><summary>ProofðŸ‘€</summary>

Let the cyclic group $(G, \circ) = \left \langle \, g \, \right \rangle$. Let $H$ be a subgroup of group $G$. Let $d$ be the smallest positive integer such that $g^d \in H$. Any other element $g^s \in H$ satisfies $s > d$. According to Euclidean division, we have $s = qd + r$, where $0 \leq r < d$. Due to closure, $g^r \in H$. Since $d$ is the smallest positive integer for which $g^d \in H$, we have $r = 0$. In other words, $d$ divides $s$, and any element in $H$ can be generated by $g^d$, i.e., $g^s = (g^d)^q$. Therefore, the subgroup $H$ is a cyclic group, and $g^d$ is the generator. Proof complete.

</details>

**3. The quotient group of a cyclic group is also a cyclic group.**

<details><summary>ProofðŸ‘€</summary>

Let the cyclic group $(G, \circ) = \left \langle \, g \, \right \rangle$. Let $H$ be a subgroup of group $G$. According to properties 1 and 2, both group $G$ and $H$ are Abelian groups, and $H$ is a normal subgroup. Therefore, we can construct the quotient group $G/H = \{gH \mid g \in G\}$. For an element $g^k$ in group $G$, there is a coset $g^kH = g^k H^k = (gH)^k$. Therefore, any element in the quotient group can be represented as $(gH)^k$, and $G/H$ is a cyclic group with the generator $gH$.

</details>

Now let's look at two examples. First, consider the integer modulo $6$ addition group $\mathbb{Z}_6$ and its normal subgroup $2\mathbb{Z}_6 = \{0, 2, 4\}$. $\mathbb{Z}_6$ is a cyclic group with generators $1$ and $5$ ($5^1 = 5$, $5^2 = 5 +5 = 4$, $5^3 = 3$, $5^4 = 2$, $5^5 = 1$, $5^6 = 0$). The normal subgroup $2\mathbb{Z}_6$ is also a cyclic group with generators $2$ or $4$. The quotient group $\mathbb{Z}_6/2\mathbb{Z}_6 = \{\{0, 2, 4\}, \{1,3,5\}\}$ is also a cyclic group with the generator $1 + 2\mathbb{Z}_6 = 5+ 2\mathbb{Z}_6 = \{1,3,5\}$, because $\{1,3,5\}^2 = 2\{1,3,5\} = \{2,4,6\}$.

Next, consider the integer modulo $5$ multiplication group $\mathbb{Z}^*_5$ and its normal subgroup $H=\{1,4\}$. $\mathbb{Z}^*_5$ is a cyclic group with generators $2$ or $3$; the normal subgroup $H=\{1,4\}$ is also a cyclic group with the generator $4$ ($4^1 = 4$ and $4^2 = 1$); the quotient group $\mathbb{Z}^*_5/H = \{\{1,4\}, \{2,3\}\}$ is also a cyclic group with the generator $2H = 3H = \{2,3\}$, because $\{2,3\}^2 = \{4, 1\}$.

### 1.2 Classification of Cyclic Groups

Cyclic groups can be classified into finite cyclic groups and infinite cyclic groups based on the number of elements.

Finite cyclic groups have a finite number of elements, such as $\mathbb{Z}_6$ and $\mathbb{Z}^*_5$.

Infinite cyclic groups have an infinite number of elements, such as $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{R}$.

## 2. Order of Elements and Order of Groups

In group theory, "order" is a concept used to describe the properties of elements in a group. In cyclic groups, the order of an element and the order of the group are related in a special way.

### 2.1 Definition of Order

The order of an element $g$ is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $g^n = e$ for $g \in G$. If such an integer does not exist, the element $g$ is said to have infinite order. The order of an element can be understood as the number of times the element needs to be combined with itself to reach the identity element.

The order of a group $G$ is the number of elements it contains, denoted as $\text{ord}(G) = |G|$.

### 2.2 Properties of Order

**1. $a^m = e$ if and only if the order $n$ of $a$ divides $m$.**

<details><summary>ProofðŸ‘€</summary>

**Sufficiency:**

According to Euclidean division, we have $m = qn+r$, where $0 \leq r < n$. Then we have $a^m = a^{qn+r} = a^{qn}a^r=(a^n)^qa^r = e a^r = a^r$. Since $0 \leq r < n$ and $n$ is the smallest positive integer for which $a^n = e$, when $a^r = e$, we have $r = 0$. In other words, $d$ divides $s$, and any element in $H$ can be generated by $g^d$, i.e., $g^s = (g^d)^q$. Therefore, the order of $g^k$ is $\frac{n}{\gcd(n,k)}$. Proof complete.

</details>

In the integer modulo $5$ multiplication group $(\mathbb{Z}^*_5, \times)$, $2^4 \equiv 16 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$, and $2^8 \equiv 256 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$.

**2. The order of a cyclic group $n$ is equal to the order of its generator: $G$ is a finite cyclic group with order $|G| = n$ if and only if the order of its generator $g$ is $n$.**

<details><summary>ProofðŸ‘€</summary>

**Sufficiency:**

According to the definition, the cyclic group $G$ is generated by $g$. If the order of $G$ is $n$, then $G = \left \langle \, g \, \right \rangle = \{e, g, ..., g^{n-1}\}$ contains $n$ different elements, so the order of the element $g$ is $n$.

**Necessity:**

According to the definition, the cyclic group $G$ is generated by $g$. If the order of $g$ is $n$, then $G = \left \langle \, g \, \right \rangle = \{e, g, ..., g^{n-1}\}$ contains $n$ different elements, so the order of the group $G$ is $n$.

</details>

In the integer modulo $5$ multiplication group $(\mathbb{Z}^*_5, \times)$, the generator $2$ or $3$ has an order of $4$, and the order of the group is also $4$.

**3. A finite cyclic group of order $n$ has a unique subgroup of order $d$ for any positive divisor $d$ of $n$.**

<details><summary>ProofðŸ‘€</summary>

First, we prove the existence of a subgroup of order $d$. Since the order of the cyclic group $G$ is $n$, we can use $g^{n/d}$ as the generator to generate the cyclic group $\left \langle \, g^{n/d} \, \right \rangle = \{e, g^{n/d}, g^{2n/d},..., g^{n-n/d}\}$, which has an order of $d$. Therefore, a subgroup of order $d$ exists.

Next, we prove the uniqueness of the subgroup of order $d$. Using proof by contradiction, assume that there is another cyclic subgroup of order $d$ in group $G$, denoted as $\left \langle \, g^{k} \, \right \rangle$, where $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. According to the definition of order, we have $(g^{k})^d = g^{kd}=  e$. According to property 1 of order, we have $n|kd$, which means $\frac{n}{d} |k$. Therefore, according to the commutative property, $\left \langle \, g^{k} \, \right \rangle$ is a subgroup of $\left \langle \, g^{n/d} \, \right \rangle$. Since they both have an order of $d$, they are the same cyclic group $\left \langle \, g^{n/d} \, \right \rangle$. Therefore, the subgroup of order $d$ is unique.

</details>

The integer modulo $6$ addition group $\mathbb{Z}_6$ has an order of $6$, so it has $4$ subgroups with orders of $1$, $2$, $3$, and $6$, which are $\{0\}, \{0,3\}, \{0,2,4\}, \{0,1,2,3,4,5\}$.

The integer modulo $5$ multiplication group $\mathbb{Z}^*_5$ has an order of $4$, so it has $3$ subgroups with orders of $1$, $2$, and $4$, which are $\{1\}, \{1, 4\}, \{1,2,3,4\}$.

**4. The order of an element $g^k$ in an $n$ order cyclic group $G$ is $\frac{n}{\gcd(n,k)}$.**

<details><summary>ProofðŸ‘€</summary>

Let $g^k$ be an element of group $G$. According to the definition of order, $m$ is the smallest positive integer such that $g^{km} = e$. According to the property of order, we have $m \equiv 0 \pmod{\frac{n}{\gcd(n,k)}}$, and the smallest positive integer satisfying this condition is $m = \frac{n}{\gcd(n,k)}$. Therefore, the order of the element $g^k$ is $\frac{n}{\gcd(n,k)}$. Proof complete.

</details>

The integer modulo $6$ addition group $\mathbb{Z}_6$ has an order of $6$. The element $2 = 1 + 1 = 1^2$ has an order of $3$, the element $3 = 1 + 1 +1 = 1^3$ has an order of $2$, the element $4 = 1^4$ has an order of $3$, and the element $5 = 1^5$ has an order of $6$.

The integer modulo $5$ multiplication group $\mathbb{Z}^*_5$ has an order of $4$. The element $2 = 2^1$ has an order of $4$, the element $3 = 2^3$ has an order of $4$, the element $4 = 2^2$ has an order of $2$, and the element $1 = 2^4$ has an order of $1$.

**5. A cyclic group of order $n$ has $\phi(n)$ generators.**

<details><summary>ProofðŸ‘€</summary>

According to the previous property, an element $g^k$ has an order of $n$ if and only if $\gcd(n, k) =1$. According to Euler's totient function, there are $\phi(n)$ integers less than $n$ and coprime to $n$. In other words, there are $\phi(n)$ values of $k$ such that $g^k$ is a generator. Therefore, a cyclic group of order $n$ has $\phi(n)$ generators. Proof complete.

</details>

The integer modulo $6$ addition group $\mathbb{Z}_6$ has an order of $6$, so it has $\phi(6) = \phi(2) \cdot \phi(3) = 1 \cdot 2 = 2$ generators, which are $1$ and $5$.

The integer modulo $5$ multiplication group $\mathbb{Z}^*_5$ has an order of $4$, so it has $\phi(4) = \phi(2^2) = 2^2 - 2 = 2$ generators, which are $2$ and $3$.

**6. The order of an element in a finite group $G$ of order $n$ is a factor of $n$.**

<details><summary>ProofðŸ‘€</summary>

Let $a \in G$. According to Lagrange's theorem, the order of a subgroup divides the order of an element, so $|\left \langle \, g \, \right \rangle|$ divides $|G| = n$. Also, since $|G| = n$ and $|a| = |\left \langle \, g \, \right \rangle|$, the order of the element is a factor of $n$. Proof complete.

</details>

The integer modulo $6$ addition group $\mathbb{Z}_6$ has an order of $6$, and the element $2$ has an order of $3$, which is a factor of $6$.

The integer modulo $5$ multiplication group $\mathbb{Z}^*_5$ has an order of $4$, and the element $4$ has an order of $2$, which is a factor of $4$.

**7. If $p$ is a prime number, then the integer modulo $p$ multiplication group $Z^*_p$ has $\phi(p-1)$ generators.**

<details><summary>ProofðŸ‘€</summary>

First, we need to determine the order of $Z^* _p$, which contains $\phi(p)$ elements. Since $p$ is a prime number, $\phi(p) = p-1$, and the order of $Z^* _p$ is $p-1$. According to property 5, it has $\phi(p-1)$ generators. Proof complete.

</details>

$5$ is a prime number, so $Z^*_5$ has $\phi(4) = \phi(2^2) = 2^2 - 2^1 = 2$ generators, which are $2$ and $3$.

## 3. Isomorphism of Cyclic Groups

In this section, we will introduce the concept of isomorphism in cyclic groups. Cyclic groups are the simplest type of groups and can be classified into two categories through isomorphism: one is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$, and the other is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_n$. Therefore, when studying the properties of cyclic groups, we can focus on the simpler $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}_n$.

**1. Any infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to the integer addition group $\mathbb{Z}$.**

<details><summary>ProofðŸ‘€</summary>

Let $G$ be an infinite cyclic group generated by $g$. Let the mapping $f: \mathbb{Z} \to G$ be defined as $f(x) = g^x$.

**Group Homomorphism:** For any $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$, we have $f(a +b) = g^{a+b} = g^ag^b = f(a)f(b)$. Therefore, $f$ is a group homomorphism.

**Surjective Homomorphism:** The image of the mapping $\{f(a) | a \in \mathbb{Z}\} = \{g^a | a \in \mathbb{Z}\} = \left \langle \, g \, \right \rangle$ is equal to the group $G$, so $f$ is a surjective homomorphism.

**Injective Homomorphism:** Since the infinite cyclic group has an infinite order, only $g^0 = e_G$ exists. Therefore, the kernel of the homomorphism $\text{ker}(f)=0$, which is the identity element of $\mathbb{Z}$. According to the necessary condition for injective homomorphism, $f$ is an injective homomorphism.

The group homomorphism $f$ is both surjective and injective, so the infinite cyclic group $G$ is isomorphic to the integer addition group $\mathbb{Z}$. Proof complete.

</details>

**2. Any finite cyclic group of order $n$ is isomorphic to the integer modulo $n$ addition group $\mathbb{Z}_n$.**

<details><summary>ProofðŸ‘€</summary>

Let $G$ be an $n$ order cyclic group generated by $g$, which can be written as $G = \left \langle \, g \, \right \rangle = \{g^a | a \in \mathbb{Z}_n\}$. Let the mapping $f: \mathbb{Z}_n \to G$ be defined as $f(x) = g^x$.

**Group Homomorphism:** For any $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}_n$, we have $f(a +b) = g^{a+b} = g^ag^b = f(a)f(b)$. Therefore, $f$ is a group homomorphism.

**Surjective Homomorphism:** The image of the mapping $\{f(a) | a \in \mathbb{Z}_n\} = \{g^a | a \in \mathbb{Z}_n\} = \left \langle \, g \, \right \rangle$ is equal to the group $G$, so $f$ is a surjective homomorphism.

**Injective Homomorphism:** The order of the generator $g$ of group $G$ is $n$, so we have $g^{kn} = e_G$, where $k$ is an integer. Therefore, the kernel of the homomorphism $\text{ker}(f)= \{kn \mod n| k \in \mathbb{Z}\}=\{0\}$, which is the identity element of $\mathbb{Z}_n$. According to the necessary condition for injective homomorphism, $f$ is an injective homomorphism.

The group homomorphism $f$ is both surjective and injective, so any $n$ order finite cyclic group $G$ is isomorphic to the integer modulo $n$ addition group $\mathbb{Z}_n$. Proof complete.

</details>

Therefore, any cyclic group $G$ is isomorphic to either $\mathbb{Z}_n$ or $\mathbb{Z}$. Isomorphism means that the two group structures are essentially the same. In other words, the properties of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ or $\mathbb{Z}$ that we have introduced earlier can be applied to any cyclic group.

## 4. Revisiting Euler's Theorem

In the basics of number theory, we introduced Euler's theorem, which relates Euler's totient function to the cyclic properties of integer modulo $n$ multiplication groups.

**Euler's Theorem:** If $a$ is an integer coprime to a positive integer $n$ (i.e., $\gcd(a,n)=1$), then $a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$.

Now let's prove it using the properties of cyclic groups.

First, consider the integer modulo $n$ multiplication group $Z^* _n$, which has an order of $\phi(n)$. Let $a$ be an integer coprime to $n$, i.e., $\gcd(a,n)= 1$, then $a \equiv 1 \mod n$, and thus $a \in Z^* _n$. We can construct a cyclic group $A$ with $a$ as the generator, then $A$ is a subgroup of $Z^* _n$. Let the order of group $A$ be $k$, then $a^k \equiv 1 \mod n$. According to Lagrange's theorem, the order of a subgroup divides the order of the group, so $k | \phi(n)$. In other words, there is an integer $q$ such that $\phi(n) = kq$. We have:

$$
a^{\phi(n)} = a^{kq} = (a^k)^q = 1^q = 1 \mod n
$$

That is, $a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \mod n$. Proof complete.

## 5. Summary

In this lesson, we explored cyclic groups, which are group structures generated by a single element. Cyclic groups are all Abelian groups. Subgroups and quotient groups of cyclic groups are also cyclic groups. The order of an element and the order of a group have special relationships. Any infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to the integer addition group $\mathbb{Z}$, and any finite cyclic group is isomorphic to the integer modulo $n$ addition group $\mathbb{Z}_n$. Therefore, when studying the properties of cyclic groups, we can focus on the simpler $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}_n$.
