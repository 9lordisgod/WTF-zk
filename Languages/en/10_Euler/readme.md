# WTF zk Tutorial 10: Euler's Theorem

Euler's Theorem is a fundamental theorem in number theory that states in modular arithmetic, for any integer coprime with the modulus, the exponentiation of that integer by the Euler function is congruent to 1 modulo the modulus. It provides a mathematical foundation for encryption algorithms such as RSA. In this tutorial, we will introduce the discrete logarithm problem, orders, and Euler's Theorem.

## 1. Discrete Logarithm Problem

The Discrete Logarithm Problem is a classic problem in mathematics and cryptography, which says that computing logarithms modulo a number is very difficult.

Given a prime number $p$ and integers $g$ and $h \in \mathbb{Z}_n^*$, we want to find an integer $x$ such that:

$$
g^x \equiv h \pmod{p}
$$

For example, for $(p, g, h) = (7, 3, 6)$, we want to find $x$ that satisfies the equation $3^x \equiv 6 \pmod{7}$. We can try to solve it using brute force:

$$
3^1 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}
$$

$$
3^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{7}
$$

$$
3^3 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
$$

Therefore, $x = 3$ satisfies the condition.

However, computing discrete logarithms gets very difficult for larger primes. For example, $(p, g, h) = (104729, 5, 3375)$ is quite challenging. The security of RSA encryption algorithm and elliptic curve cryptography relies on the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem, so larger and harder to compute parameters are chosen.

## 2. Orders

Let $a \in \mathbb{Z}_n$, the smallest integer $k$ that satisfies $a^k \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$ is called the order of the element $a$.

For example:

For modulo $n = 5$ and $a = 2$, we have:

$$
2^1 = 2 \pmod{5}
$$

$$
2^2 = 4 \pmod{5}
$$

$$
2^3 = 8 = 3 \pmod{5}
$$

$$
2^4 = 16 = 1 \pmod{5}
$$

Therefore, the order of $a$ is $4$. The order of an element is important because it characterizes the cyclic property of the set of elements. We can see that $2^5 = 2 \cdot 2^4 = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \pmod{5}$, which falls into the next cycle of $\{2, 4, 3, 1\}$.

### 2.1 Properties of Orders

In number theory, order is an important concept that represents the cyclic property between an element and a modulus. The following are some important properties of the order:

#### 1. If the order of $a$ is $k$, then $a^j \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$ if and only if $k$ divides $j$.

Continuing with the previous example, $a = 2, n = 5$, the order of $a$ is $4$, and $2^8 \equiv 256 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$, which shows that $4$ divides $8$.

First, let's express $j$ in terms of $k$. According to the Euclidean division theorem, we have

$$
j = qk + r
$$

where $0 \le r < k$. Substitute it back into the original equation:

$$
a^j = a^{qk+r} = a^{qk}a^r = (a^{k})^qa^r \equiv 1 \pmod{n}
$$

Since $a^k \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$, we can simplify $(a^{k})^q\equiv 1 \pmod{n}$, and the above equation becomes:

$$
a^r \equiv 1 \pmod{n}
$$

According to the definition of order, $k$ is the smallest integer that satisfies $a^k \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$, and since $0 \le r < k$, it follows that $r = 0$. Therefore, we have:

$$
j = qk
$$

Thus, $k$ divides $j$, and the proof is complete.

#### 2. If $a$ is coprime with the modulus $n$, then the order $k$ of $a$ divides $\phi(n)$, where $\phi(n)$ is the Euler's totient function.

This property involves Euler's Theorem, which we will introduce in the next section.

According to Euler's Theorem, we have $a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$. According to the first property: If the order of $a$ is $k$, then $a^j \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$ if and only if $k$ divides $j$. Therefore, $k$ divides $\phi(n)$.  Proof complete.

## 3. Euler's Theorem

Euler's Theorem relates Euler's function and the cyclic property of exponentiation.

**Theorem:** If the integer $a$ and the positive integer $n$ are coprime (i.e., $\gcd(a,n)=1$), then $a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$.

Here, $\phi(n)$ is Euler's function, which counts the number of integers in the range $[1, ..., n-1]$ that are coprime with $n$.

Continuing with the previous example, $a = 2, n = 5$, first calculate $\phi(5) = 5-1 = 4$, then we have $2^4 \equiv 16 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$, which satisfies Euler's Theorem.

Here's another example, $a = 3, n = 7$, first calculate $\phi(7)=7-1=6$, then apply Euler's Theorem to get $3^6 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$. Checking $3^6 = 729$, with a remainder of $1$ when divided by $7$, Euler's Theorem is correct.

<details><summary>Click to expand the proof ðŸ‘€</summary>

Consider the set $S = Z_n^* = \{1 \le x \le n | \gcd(x,n) = 1\}$. We know that $S$ has $\phi(n)$ elements, and we can represent them as $\{x_1, x_2, ..., x_{\phi(n)}\}$.

Now consider another set $S'$, whose elements are obtained by multiplying the elements in $S$ by $a$. It can be represented as:

$S' = aS = \{ax_1, ax_2, ..., ax_{\phi(n)}\}$

**Lemma 1:** $\gcd(ax_i,n) = 1$.

Proof: Since $\gcd(a, n) = 1$ and $\gcd(x_i,n) = 1$, it follows that $\gcd(ax_i,n) = 1$.

**Lemma 2:** No two elements in $S'$ are congruent modulo $n$.

Proof: Assume that there exist two elements in $S'$, $ax_i$ and $ax_j$, that are congruent modulo $n$, i.e., $ax_i \equiv ax_j \pmod{n}$. This implies $a(x_i - x_j) \equiv 0 \pmod{n}$, which means $n$ divides $a(x_i - x_j)$, i.e., $n|a(x_i- x_j)$. Since $\gcd(a, n) = 1$, it follows that $n|(x_i- x_j)$, i.e., $x_i- x_j = kn$. Since $1 \le x_i, x_j \le n$, we have $x_i - x_j = 0$, which means $x_i = x_j$, i.e., $i=j$. Therefore, $x_i$ is congruent to $x_j$ if and only if $i=j$. Proof complete.

According to Lemma 1 and Lemma 2, we know that $S'$ consists of $\phi(n)$ elements that are coprime with $n$, and they are pairwise incongruent. In other words, $S' = Z_n^*$, which contains the same elements as $S$ (but the order may be different).

Next, we multiply all elements in both $S$ and $S'$, and they should be congruent, i.e.,

$$(ax_1)(ax_2)...(ax_{\phi(n)}) \equiv x_1x_2...x_{\phi(n)} \pmod{n}$$

Taking out all the $a$'s, there are $\phi(n)$ of them, we have:

$$a^{\phi(n)} x_1x_2...x_{\phi(n)}  \equiv x_1x_2...x_{\phi(n)} \pmod{n}$$

Let $X = x_1x_2...x_{\phi(n)}$, with $\gcd(X,n) = 1$. The equation can be simplified to:

$$a^{\phi(n)} X  \equiv X \pmod{n}$$

Since $X^{-1}$ exists, we can multiply both sides by $X^{-1}$ and simplify, we obtain:

$$a^{\phi(n)}  \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$$

Proof complete!

### 3.1 Relationship with Fermat's Little Theorem

We can easily prove Fermat's Little Theorem using Euler's Theorem.

According to Euler's Theorem: If the integer $a$ and the positive integer $n$ are coprime (i.e., $\gcd(a,n)=1$), then $a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$.

When $n$ is a prime number, $\phi(n)=n-1$, substituting it into the original theorem, we have $a^{n-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$, which is equivalent to $a^{n} \equiv a \pmod{n}$. In this way, we have proved Fermat's Little Theorem, which can be considered as a special case of Euler's Theorem when $n$ is a prime number.

### 3.2 Code Implementation

You can verify Euler's Theorem in Python:

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def euler_phi(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if gcd(n, i) == 1:
            count += 1
    return count

def euler_theorem(a, n):
    if gcd(a, n) != 1:
